<p>The theme of my story is My Way to Work. I chose this theme since is what i do on a daily basis before getting to work. Another reason why i chose this theme is because the task i complete before getting to work can always change.</p>
<p>In my code i used conditional statements to make decisions on the different tasks that i can complete before i get to work. An example is the first condition statement of if alarm rings at 5:00 am i display on the console "I wake up at 5:00 am."</p>
